scripts/warm_top_picks.py — Scheduled Top Picks pre-warm job.

FIX SPEED1. Runs on a schedule (GitHub Actions — see
.github/workflows/warm-top-picks.yml) and writes a fresh Top Picks scan
result to trade_store (shared Postgres, set via DATABASE_URL) so the
deployed app can read it instantly instead of paying the ~2-minute
cold-scan cost on whichever visit happens to hit an expired in-app cache.

Why this exists: dashboard/shared/cache.py's _home_top_picks() scans the
full niftytotalmarket universe (~745 tickers) and can take up to ~2 minutes
cold. It's cached with @st.cache_data(ttl=300), but that cache is
process-local to the running Streamlit Cloud container — it doesn't survive
a redeploy/restart, and on a low-traffic app it routinely expires between
visits. Whoever's browser session happens to hit the expired cache pays the
full cold scan.

This script runs the same scan headlessly and writes the result to
trade_store, which GitHub Actions and the deployed app both have real
network access to. The app's get_top_picks() reads this snapshot first and
only falls back to its own live scan if the snapshot is missing or older
than _TOP_PICKS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS — see dashboard/shared/cache.py.

NOTE: this deliberately imports dashboard.shared.cache and calls
_home_top_picks() directly (with the same vix_regime/sector_ranks inputs
get_top_picks() itself would use), plus reuses the module's own KV key
constants, rather than re-implementing the scan/persist logic here — so
there is exactly one place that logic lives and this can never drift from
what the app itself would compute. Same discipline as
warm_tomorrow_watchlist.py.

Exit codes: always 0 — a failed warm-up should not fail the workflow or
block the next scheduled attempt; the app already degrades gracefully to a
live scan if no fresh snapshot is available.
