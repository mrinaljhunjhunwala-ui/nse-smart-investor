"""
scripts/warm_tomorrow_watchlist.py — Scheduled Tomorrow's Watchlist pre-warm job.

FIX W-SPEED. Runs once after NSE market close (GitHub Actions — see
.github/workflows/warm-tomorrow-watchlist.yml) and writes a fresh
Tomorrow's Watchlist scan result to trade_store (shared Postgres, set via
DATABASE_URL).

Why this exists: dashboard/shared/cache.py's _tomorrow_watchlist() scans the
full Nifty 500 universe and can take up to ~2 minutes cold. It's cached with
@st.cache_data(ttl=3600), but that cache is process-local to the running
Streamlit Cloud container — it doesn't survive a redeploy/restart, and on a
low-traffic app it routinely expires between visits. Whoever's browser
session happens to hit the expired cache pays the full cold scan — this is
the exact same problem scripts/warm_top_picks.py already solved for Command
Centre's Top Picks (FIX SPEED1), just never extended to this page.

This script runs the same scan headlessly and writes the result to
trade_store, which GitHub Actions and the deployed app both have real
network access to. The app's cache.get_tomorrow_watchlist() reads this
snapshot first and only falls back to its own live scan if the snapshot is
missing or older than 6 hours — see dashboard/shared/cache.py.

NOTE: this deliberately imports dashboard.shared.cache and calls
_tomorrow_watchlist() directly rather than re-implementing the scan/bucket
logic here, so there is exactly one place that logic lives and this can
never drift from what the app itself would compute — same discipline as
warm_top_picks.py.

Exit codes: always 0 — a failed warm-up should not fail the workflow or
block the next scheduled attempt; the app already degrades gracefully to a
live scan if no fresh snapshot is available.
