analysis/final_verdict.py — the ONE answer.

Problem this solves
───────────────────
The app currently produces up to seven partial verdicts for a single ticker:

  1. Composite score       (analysis/score.py)              — trade now?
  2. TQS                   (analysis/trend_quality_score)   — trend healthy?
  3. Qualitative flags     (analysis/qualitative_flags)     — governance?
  4. Thesis verdict        (analysis/thesis/thesis_engine)  — story holds?
  5. Valuation posture     (analysis/fundamentals/          — overpaying?
                             valuation_decision)
  6. Fundamental quality   (research/fundamental_quality)   — good business?
  7. Portfolio fit         (analysis/thesis/portfolio_fit)  — fits book?

Each answers a different question, and users have been asked to synthesise
seven partial answers themselves. That was the "seven-scores problem"
flagged in the assessment. This module produces ONE coherent verdict that
composes them, without hiding what each subsystem said.

Design principle
────────────────
Not a weighted sum. A DECISION TREE. Quality and governance are GATES
(they can veto a BUY no matter how good the technical setup looks).
Valuation is a DAMPER (a "STRONG BUY" on an overpriced name gets
downgraded, not vetoed). Technical setup is what turns a "watch-worthy"
name into an "act today" call — it's the LAST filter, not the first.

This is the Buffett/Munger circle-of-competence structure: rule out on
quality first, price second, timing third. Any single-number aggregator
that ignores this ordering will happily flash STRONG BUY on a fraud with
great momentum, which is the exact failure mode we want to prevent.

Inputs are all OPTIONAL. Callers pass whatever they've computed; missing
inputs are treated as unknown, not as bad. The verdict records confidence
based on how many gates were actually evaluable — a verdict with 5/5 gates
firm is HIGH confidence; with only 2/5 available is LOW.

Nothing here fetches data. Callers (dashboard pages / research scripts)
are the appropriate place to decide what to compute.

    Combine every subsystem's output into ONE verdict.

    Every argument is optional; a caller that only has half the pieces
    still gets a defensible answer, just with lower confidence.

    `horizon` — one of "short" | "medium" | "long" (default "medium",
    which preserves the original single-lens behaviour). Different
    horizons re-weight the SAME subsystem outputs — a bad valuation is
    a big damp long-term but nearly zero short-term; a technical EXIT
    is a veto short-term but only a damp long-term. See _HORIZON_WEIGHTS
