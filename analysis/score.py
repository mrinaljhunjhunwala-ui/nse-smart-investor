analysis/score.py
Composite Stock Score — 0 to 100 — with grade, action verdict,
entry/SL/TP levels, and a plain-English narrative for non-traders.

Score breakdown (90 pts max):
    Technical   40 pts  — RSI, MACD, SMA stack, ADX
    Momentum    25 pts  — 5d / 20d / 60d returns
    Volume      15 pts  — Volume ratio, OBV trend
    Sentiment   10 pts  — India VIX regime + sector rank

Candlestick patterns are detected and shown in the narrative but are NOT
scored. The 5-year variant study (docs/RESEARCH_SCORE_VARIANTS.md, 40,663
observations) found the 10-pt pattern component contributed zero-to-negative
ranking power in every market regime. See docs/PATTERN_REMOVAL_MIGRATION.md.

Grades:   A+ (≥88) | A (≥75) | B (≥62) | C (≥48) | D (≥32) | F (<32)
Actions:  STRONG BUY | BUY | WATCHLIST | HOLD | CAUTION | EXIT

Fixes applied vs previous version:
  - sys.path.insert moved to module level (was inside score_stock — ran on every call)
  - All heavy imports moved to module level with _DEPS_LOADED guard
  - _score_pattern renamed _detect_patterns: returns Dict only (no phantom numeric score)
  - CompositeScore.pattern_score removed; patterns_detected: List[str] added
  - resolve_ticker now catches Exception (was ValueError only — other errors crashed page)
  - Score cap corrected to 90 (was 100 — unreachable, misleading)
  - Sector rank thresholds now derived from n_sectors (were hardcoded 5/10)
  - Momentum fallback now sets is_fallback=True flag so narrative can note it
  - Windows UTF-8 fix moved out of module body into _setup_encoding() called once

# Pat_BullEngulfing, Pat_BearEngulfing, Pat_MorningStar, Pat_EveningStar,

# with `if col in recent.columns` / `cur.get(col, 0)`, the omission did not
# raise — it silently returned an EMPTY pattern list for every stock scored
# through score_stock(), which is the entry point behind Top Picks, the
# screener, Analyze Stock, Watchlist and Quality Watch. Downstream that meant:
#   * CompositeScore.patterns_detected was always []

#   * _build_narrative()'s sentence 4 could never take the pattern branch, so
#     the "volume × pattern confirmation" line and the bearish-pattern warning
#     were dead code for the main path
# i.e. a documented, user-facing feature was switched off by an optimisation
# that only audited the *numeric* score's column reads and missed the narrative
# layer's. The tests didn't catch it because test_smoke_score_indicators.py only
# asserts `isinstance(cs.patterns_detected, list)` — [] satisfies that.
#
# Both groups are cheap enough to restore: "patterns" is fully vectorised, and
# "divergence" is now vectorised too (FIX IND5 in utils/indicators.py replaced
# its per-bar Python loop with sliding_window_view), so this no longer

    `dispersion` is the current cross-sectional 20-day return dispersion
    across the universe, as produced by
    analysis.regime.cross_sectional_dispersion_20d. When passed and below
    the low-dispersion threshold, the narrative for BUY/STRONG BUY signals
    gets a warning suffix — see FIX REGIME-DISP-SCORE below. Optional;
    callers that don't have it (e.g. single-stock ad-hoc scoring) can
    still pass None and get the previous behavior unchanged.
