"""
Live canary for data/nse_corp_info.py - one of the two providers the
2026-09-06 audit caught silently 404-ing (finding #4). Would have caught
the /api/corporate-info retirement the day it happened.

Marked `slow` per Task 2.5 - stays out of the default `pytest` lane; run
with `pytest -m slow` on a periodic sweep.

The canary asserts three things against the live endpoint:
  1. The URL the fetcher constructs actually returns 200 (URL not retired)
  2. The response is a dict (JSON body parsed cleanly)
  3. At least one of the keys the qualitative-flags pipeline reads is
     present. Absence of ALL known keys is drift; individual keys can go
     empty on a low-news day without failing this check.

    going dark and someone needs to look at data/nse_corp_info.py.
