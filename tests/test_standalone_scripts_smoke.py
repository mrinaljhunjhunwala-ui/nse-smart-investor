"""tests/test_standalone_scripts_smoke.py — import-smoke coverage for standalone scripts.

FIX GAP1 — alerts/check_alerts.py, and every script under research/, had ZERO test
coverage: not a single pytest imported them, so `python -m py_compile` was the only
thing standing between a broken file and production. That gap is exactly how a
copy-paste mistake (an entire unrelated module's content pasted into
alerts/check_alerts.py, overwriting the real Telegram alert script) shipped to `main`
and passed all 301 existing tests undetected — the corrupted file was simply never
touched by anything in tests/.

This file closes that gap cheaply: it discovers every standalone script (one with a
`if __name__ == "__main__":` guard, so a plain import has no side effects — no network
calls, no Telegram sends, no argparse execution) and asserts it at least
    1. compiles (py_compile) — catches syntax errors
    2. imports cleanly — catches broken/misplaced-relative imports (this is exactly
       what would have caught the check_alerts.py incident: the corrupted file failed
       importlib.import_module with "attempted relative import beyond top-level
       package")
    3. still exposes the specific public entry points each script is known to need
       (e.g. check_alerts.py must still have `main` and `send_telegram`) — catches a
       "imports fine but is quietly the wrong file" mistake that a bare import check
       alone would miss.

This deliberately does NOT call main() for any of these — most need live credentials,
network access, or write to real state files, which is out of place in a fast unit
suite. Import-level verification is the right amount of coverage for "did this file
get clobbered," which is the failure mode this test exists to catch.
