data/nse_rss_feeds.py — QF5: NSE's official RSS syndication feeds.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    data/nse_corp_info.py hits nseindia.com's dynamic JSON API
    (www.nseindia.com/api/*), which sits behind an aggressive WAF that
    frequently blocks cloud/datacenter IPs (see that module's "KNOWN
    OPERATIONAL LIMITATION"). NSE ALSO publishes official RSS feeds on a
    completely different host — nsearchives.nseindia.com — a static
    content/archive subdomain built for third-party syndication. This is
    NOT a scrape of an undocumented endpoint: NSE's own "RSS Feeds" page
    (nseindia.com/static/rss-feed) publishes these URLs explicitly for
    external consumption, so there's no ToS ambiguity the way there would
    be scraping Screener.in or similar. In testing, this host responded
    successfully where the JSON API host did not — consistent with static-
    archive subdomains generally having a much lighter WAF profile than
    dynamic API hosts.

WHAT THIS COVERS THAT NOTHING ELSE IN THIS APP DOES
    Several of these feeds are the actual "external factors" / red-flag
    category the whole qualitative-flags effort has been chasing, sourced
    directly from the regulatory disclosure itself rather than a third
    party's interpretation of it (e.g. Screener's Red Flags section):
      - Related Party Transactions — the single most-cited governance
        red flag category
      - Reason For Encumbrance — WHY shares were pledged, not just that
        they were (a promoter pledging to fund a personal loan reads very
        differently from pledging to fund a rights issue)
      - SAST Regulation 29 / 31 — substantial acquisition of shares /
        continuing disclosure of promoter holding changes (takeover-
        relevant, and a second independent check on promoter holding
        trend alongside the shareholding-pattern parsing already in
        analysis/qualitative_flags.py)
      - Corporate Governance — governance-specific filings distinct from
        the general announcements feed already covered by nse_corp_info.py

IMPORTANT — these are MARKET-WIDE feeds (every listed company in one XML
    file), not per-ticker. Each feed is fetched and cached ONCE (not once
    per ticker), then filtered client-side for the company being looked
    up. This is far more efficient than a per-ticker fetch would be, and
    is exactly why these feeds exist as a syndication product in the
    first place — one feed serves every consumer.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
    * Does not raise on failure — same discipline as every other fetcher
      in this pipeline; a broken feed must never block the rest of the
      qualitative-flags pipeline.
    * Does not attempt company-name disambiguation beyond substring
      matching — if two listed companies share a very similar name this
      could occasionally cross-match; treat matches as "worth a human
      read", same posture as every other auto-detected flag in this app.
