utils/live_price.py — Real-time NSE equity prices.

Tier hierarchy (fastest → most reliable fallback):
  Tier 0: Angel One SmartAPI   — true real-time LTP, no delay, official exchange feed.
           get_live_prices_batch() uses get_batch_quotes() (up to 50 symbols per HTTP
           call) so the entire portfolio/scanner resolves in 1–2 network round-trips
           instead of N parallel single-symbol calls that trip the rate limiter.
  Tier 1: Yahoo Finance JSON API — direct HTTP, no library, works from cloud IPs.
           Returns regularMarketPrice which is live during market hours but can be
           15-min delayed outside them or when Yahoo throttles cloud IPs.
  Tier 2: NSE India official API — real-time but needs session cookies; may return
           403 from datacenter IPs (Streamlit Cloud included).
  Tier 3: Stooq EOD             — yesterday's close, never fails, last resort.

Root cause of previous price variance
──────────────────────────────────────
The old get_live_prices_batch() called get_live_quote() once per symbol inside a
ThreadPoolExecutor. Each call hit _get_token() (rate-limited at 1 req/s) + a quote
endpoint call with NO rate limit. With 8 workers and N stocks, Angel One received a
burst of N requests in a few seconds, responded with empty/error bodies, and every
symbol silently fell through to Yahoo's 15-min delayed regularMarketPrice — even
though Angel One credentials were perfectly valid.

Fix: batch path calls angel_fetcher.get_batch_quotes() which sends all symbols in
a single "mode=FULL, exchangeTokens={NSE: [tok1,tok2,...]}" POST (max 50 per call).
Token lookup is the only sequential step (still rate-limited); the quote fetch itself
is one round-trip per 50 symbols. Symbols not resolved by Angel One fall back to the
per-symbol Yahoo → NSE → Stooq chain.

FIX LP1 — get_live_prices_batch()'s fallback ThreadPoolExecutor used a flat
20-second `wait(timeout=20)` regardless of how many symbols needed the
fallback chain. Each fallback call can take up to ~24s in the worst case
(Yahoo's 8s timeout + NSE's 6s + Stooq's 10s, tried sequentially when all
three fail). With max_workers=8, any remaining list bigger than 8 needs
multiple sequential "rounds" through the pool — e.g. 20 remaining symbols
needs ceil(20/8)=3 rounds, up to ~72s worst case — but the old code only
ever waited 20s total, then silently abandoned everything still running:
those symbols' results were never collected and just stayed None. This is
exactly the scenario this fallback path exists for (Angel One Tier-0 not
covering a chunk of symbols — circuit breaker tripped, new listings, BSE-
only names), so it tended to fail precisely when it mattered most. Fixed by
scaling the wait to the actual workload (bounded so one bad batch can't hang
the page indefinitely) and logging — not silently dropping — anything still
outstanding when the wait ends.

    Batch strategy
    ──────────────
    Tier 0 (Angel One): calls get_batch_quotes() which groups all symbols into
    50-symbol bulk POST requests.  The entire list resolves in ceil(N/50) round-
    trips — typically 1 for a portfolio, 2–3 for a 100-stock screener scan.
    This replaces the old approach of N parallel get_live_quote() calls which
    saturated Angel One's rate limiter and caused silent fallthrough to Yahoo.

    Any symbol that Angel One returns None for (not configured, circuit breaker
    tripped, delisted, BSE-only stock) falls back to the per-symbol Yahoo →
    NSE → Stooq chain via a thread pool.

    FIX LP1: the fallback wait is now sized to the actual remaining workload
    (each fetch_fn already self-bounds to 6-10s per call, ~24s worst case per
    symbol across all 3 tiers) instead of a flat 20s that silently truncated
    anything past the first round of max_workers symbols. See module docstring.

    FIX LP2 — max_wait_seconds: LP1's scaled wait (rounds * 26 + 4, capped at
    120s) is appropriate for a background scan page (Smart Screener, Tomorrow's
    Watchlist) where the person expects a scan to take a while and the page
    has nothing else competing for that time. It is NOT appropriate for
    dashboard/shared/nav.py's sidebar, which calls this on every single page
    load — with Angel One not configured (is_configured() fails instantly,
    with no network call, so EVERY symbol falls into this fallback path) and
    Yahoo/NSE/Stooq degraded (as commonly happens on Streamlit Cloud's shared
    IPs — see live_price.py's own module docstring on cloud-IP blocking), a
    12-ticker watchlist alone could block the sidebar — and therefore every
    page in the app — for up to 56 seconds, and a 20-ticker list up to 82s.
    max_wait_seconds lets latency-sensitive callers opt into a hard, low
    ceiling instead. It only ever shortens the wait (via min()), never
    lengthens it, so passing nothing at all preserves the exact previous
    behavior for existing callers (e.g. scanner pages) — nothing changes for
    them. Symbols still outstanding when the (shorter) wait ends are logged
    and returned as None, same graceful-degradation path as before; the
    person just sees "price unavailable, refresh to retry" instead of a
    frozen page for the better part of a minute.
